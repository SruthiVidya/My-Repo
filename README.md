STOPWATCH_KOTLIN
  Hi I made this mini-project that measures elapsed time by counting timer ticks in the underlying timer mechanism. 
  The Start button is clicked, then eventually click the Stop button to end the timer. 
  
  I got to have hands on experience on:
      Kotlin
      Android Studio
      XML
