# STOPWATCH_KOTLIN

  Hi I made this mini-project that measures elapsed time by counting timer ticks in the underlying timer mechanism. 
  The Start button is clicked, then eventually click the Stop button to end the timer. The current value of the timer is displayed
  
  I got to have hands on experience on:
     <li> Kotlin
     <li> Android Studio
     <li> XML
